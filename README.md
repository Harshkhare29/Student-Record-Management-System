# Student-Record-Management-System
A Student Record Management System (SRMS) in Java is a software application designed to efficiently manage and organize student-related data within an educational institution.
Student Data Management (CRUD Operations):
Create: Adding new student records with details such as ID, name, age, grade, contact information, and other relevant academic or personal data.
Read/Retrieve: Viewing individual student details or displaying a list of all students. This often includes search functionalities based on criteria like student ID or name.
Update: Modifying existing student information to reflect changes in academic performance, contact details, or other relevant attributes.
Delete: Removing student records from the system, typically when a student leaves the institution.
